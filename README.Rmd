## LSTDConnect

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of LSTDConnect is to serve as a companion package for the National Connectivity Analysis paper (in prep). It implements a limited and parallel version of the SAMC analysis (see the [`samc`](https://github.com/andrewmarx/samc) package and associated [publication](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ele.13333)).

### Installation

You can install the development version of LSTDConnect from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("LandSciTech/LSTDConnect")
```

### Vignette

See the vignette "SAMC Comparison" for a comparison of the SAMC implementations in this package and the [`samc`](https://github.com/andrewmarx/samc) package.
